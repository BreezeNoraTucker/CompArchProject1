I did not have the time to test these circuits, just getting them to 
compile took a significant amount of time.
Getting inout coercion warnings, unsure why those are being caused,
and if that is a genuine issue.
Had several syntax struggle points, for example figuring out that a 
variable 
could not have a name beginning with an integer took longer than 
I would like to admit.
Attempted to use loops to get around need to copy paste so many lines,
could not figure out that syntax. Ended up using python scripts to 
generate
repeated lines for iterated indexes.
